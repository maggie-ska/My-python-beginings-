March 2013 a Dragon spacecraft in orbit evelope issues with its thrusters that limite its control capabilities SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages within a short perio an the spacecraft was able to successfully complete its mission to an from the International Space Station\\n\\nIn late June 2015 CRS7 launche a Cargo Dragon atop a Falcon 9 to resupply the International Space Station All telemetry reaings were nominal until 2 minutes an 19 secons into the flight when a loss of helium pressure was etecte an a clou of vapor appeare outsie the secon stage A few secons after this the secon stage exploe The first stage continue to fly for a few secons before isintegrating ue to aeroynamic forces The capsule was thrown off an survive the explosion transmitting ata until it was estroye on impact84 Later it was reveale that the capsule coul have lane intact if it ha software to eploy its parachutes in case of a launch mishap85 The problem was iscovere to be a faile 2footlong steel strut purchase from a supplier86 to hol a helium pressure vessel that broke free ue to the force of acceleration87 This cause a breach an allowe highpressure helium to escape into the lowpressure propellant tank causing the failure The Dragon software issue was also fixe in aition to an analysis of the entire program in orer to ensure proper abort mechanisms are in place for future rockets an their payloa88\\n\\nIn early September 2016 a Falcon 9 exploe uring a propellant fill operation for a stanar prelaunch static fire test8990 The payloa the Spacecom Amos6 communications satellite value at 200 million was estroye91 Musk escribe the event as the most ifficult an complex failure in SpaceXs history SpaceX reviewe nearly 3000 channels of telemetry an vieo ata covering a perio of 35â€“55 millisecons for the postmortem92 Musk reporte that the explosion was cause by the liqui oxygen that is use as propellant turning so col that it soliifie an ignite with carbon composite helium vessels93 Though not consiere an unsuccessful flight the rocket explosion sent the company into a fourmonth launch hiatus while it worke out what went wrong SpaceX returne to flight in January 201794\\n\\nOn June 28 2019 SpaceX announce that it ha lost contact with three of the 60 satellites making up the Starlink mega constellation The ysfunctional satellites orbits are expecte to slowly ecay until they isintegrate in the atmosphere95 However the rate of failure for satellites in megaconstellations consisting of thousans of satellites has raise concerns that these constellations coul litter the Earths lower orbit with serious etrimental consequences for future space flights96\\n\\nOwnership funing an valuation\\nIn August 2008 SpaceX accepte a US20 million investment from Founers Fun97 In early 2012 approximately twothirs of the company stock was owne by its founer98 an his 70 million shares were then estimate to be worth 875 million on private markets99 which roughly value SpaceX at 13 billion as of February 2012100 After the COTS 2 flight in May 2012 the company private equity valuation nearly ouble to US24 billion101102 By May 2012â€”ten years after founingâ€”SpaceX ha operate on total funing of approximately US1 billion over its first ecae of operation Of this private equity provie approximately US200 million with Musk investing approximately US100 million an other investors having put in about US100 million Founers Fun Draper Fisher Jurvetson etc103 The remainer ha come from progress payments on longterm launch contracts an

at approximately US12 billion Google an Fielity joine prior investors Draper Fisher Jurvetson Founers Fun Valor Equity Partners an Capricorn104105 In July 2017 the Company raise US350 million at a valuation of US21 billion106\\n\\nCongressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggeste that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of setting only a highlevel requirement for cargo transport to the space station while leaving the etails to inustry ha allowe SpaceX to esign an evelop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost Accoring to NASAs own inepenently verifie numbers SpaceXs total evelopment cost for both the Falcon 1 an Falcon 9 rockets was estimate at approximately US390 million In 2011 NASA estimate that it woul have cost the agency about US4 billion to evelop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster base upon NASAs traitional contracting processes about ten times more107\\n\\nBy March 2018 SpaceX ha contracts for 100 launch missions an each of those contracts provies own payments at contract signing plus many are paying progress payments as launch vehicle components are built in avance of mission launch riven in part by US accounting rules for recognizing longterm revenue48\\n\\n\\nSuccessful SpaceX launches by year108\\nSpaceX raise a total of US133 billion of capital across three funing rouns in 2019109 In April 2019 the Wall Street Journal reporte the
